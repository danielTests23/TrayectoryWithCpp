# What is a variable?

A variable is the most important thing of the [imperative programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/), essentially, a variable is a simple way to just store values (all the values you can imagine), this variable in programming is stored in the memory of your computer (To be more specific, in the [stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-vs-heap-memory-allocation/))


To be more explanative, let's go to a more creative explanation.
You have apples that you sell everyday, and the value of the price of it, you need to keep it in a space of your memory, in this way:

```cpp
int priceApple {5};
```
> The int word means integer, is a necessary identifier to lend the compiler understand you are using integer numbers.

Now let's imagine that you change the price of your apples, so you need to update the price, you can do it on this way:

```cpp
priceApple{6};
```

So, there is the main utility of the variables, are mutable and lend the user manipulate them everything as it needed.

You can have a lot of variables and use them as you want, you can use primitive type of variables of cpp or create your own types, here im gonna show you examples of the usage of variables:

**Sum**
```cpp
int a{2};
int b{4};
int c=a+b;
```


**Congrats!!**
Now you can understand the meaning of variables
