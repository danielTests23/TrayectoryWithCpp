# Data types

In c++, you can choose from a variety of types of variables that are already supported in C++.

There are 4 **fundamental** data types, which are:

- [**Character**](#character-type)
- **Integer**
- **Float**
- **Boolean**

Let's go to understand how can we manage each data type and the impact in performance, because, as you saw in the [introduction](./IntroVariables.md) each variable has a storage in the memory.

## Character type.

This data type just represent a single character, you can store in this type of variable a letter like 'W' or symbols as "#".

**Example:**

```cpp
char letter='a';
```

**ASCII values**

I'll be updating this guide and show you what is the ASCII table and it's functionality in this [section](../../generalKnowledge/), meanwhile, you can check what is in this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)

- ASCII Range of ‘a’ to ‘z’ =  97-122

- ASCII Range of ‘A’ to ‘Z’ =  65-90

- ASCII Range of ‘0’ to ‘9’ = 48-57


### Sizes

Char has 4 different types that are differenced for the size in memory that the variables can store. Any of these types can use [UNICODE](https://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html).

#### Char 

- Size: 1 byte in size. (8 bits)
