# Welcome to my Cpp Course

## Introduction to this guide

Hello, this is a guide to learn **C++**, the idea is while I'm learning about this language, I'll be updating this repository to share content to others that are just starting and want to learn with some deeply explanations, I'm open to recomendations for this guide.

I'll hope you like this guide!

### Sections

#### Bash  

While im learning about cpp and creating the guide, I'll try to optimize my tasks using [bash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4EWvMFj37g),I'll share all the codes that I've used in the section of **[bashScripts](./bashScripts/)**, each code is commented so you can check that if you're stuck with other problems.

#### Readme Notes
Also I'm writing this guide in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), I'm also learning about this so I'll be updating the section of **[readmeNotes](./readmeNotes/)** to share some tips that I find.

#### Cpp Course
For this section I'll be exploring with detail all the content of Cpp, I'm gonna try to be the most specific that I can, if you find some areas of oportunity in this course, just contact me. I'll be updating constantly this section named **[cppCourse](./cppCourse/)**
